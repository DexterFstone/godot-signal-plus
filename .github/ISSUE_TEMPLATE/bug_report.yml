      description: |
        Describe your issue briefly. What doesn't work, and how do you expect it to work instead?
        You can include images or videos with drag and drop, and format code blocks or logs with <code>\`\`\`</code> tags, on separate lines before and after the text. (Use <code>\`\`\`gdscript</code> to add GDScript syntax highlighting.)
        Please do not add code examples or error messages as screenshots, but as text, this helps searching for issues and testing the code. If you are reporting a bug in the editor interface, like the script editor, please provide both a screenshot *and* the text of the code to help with testing.

        List of steps or sample code that reproduces the issue. Having reproducible issues is a prerequisite for contributors to be able to solve them.
        If you include a minimal reproduction project below, you can detail how to use it here.

        - A small Godot project which reproduces the issue, with no unnecessary files included. Be sure to not include the `.godot` folder in the archive (but keep `project.godot`).
        - Having an MRP is very important for contributors to be able to reproduce the bug in the same way that you are experiencing it. When testing a potential fix for the issue, contributors will use the MRP to validate that the fix is working as intended.
        - If the reproduction steps are not project dependent (e.g. the bug is visible in a brand new project), you can write "N/A" in the field.
        - Drag and drop a ZIP archive to upload it (max 10 MB). **Do not select another field until the project is done uploading.**
        - **Note for C# users:** If your issue is *not* C#-specific, please upload a minimal reproduction project written in GDScript. This will make it easier for contributors to reproduce the issue locally as not everyone has a .NET setup available.
